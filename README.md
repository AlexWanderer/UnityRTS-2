# UnityRTS

Tech:
	
    Singleplayer RTS built in Unity. Focus was on pathfinding, dynamic building placement, and cool tech trees. 
    Originally planned to make it a multiplayer game, but we ran out of time and had to scale back while still trying to maintain a fun experience.

Goal:
	
    Destroy the enemy's base before running out of time!

Controls:
	
    Select a unit/building by left clicking on it
    Shift + Drag for marquee selection
    Ctrl + left click to add/remove unit to/from currently selected group 
    
    Miltary units can attack by left clicking on an enemy unit
    Builders can build by left clicking a building on their context menu and then left clicking on the ground to place
    Space to rotate a building being placed
    The more builders on a building, the faster it builds.
   	
    Set a building's rally point by left clicking on the ground
    Create new units by left clicking on the unit in the context menu
